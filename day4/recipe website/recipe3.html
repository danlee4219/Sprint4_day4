      <p>Paneer Kathi Roll is a popular Indian street food where lachha parathas are slathered with green chutney and stuffed with a spicy paneer bell pepper filling. Serve them for a filling meal any time of the day.Paneer Kathi Roll is a street-style wrap where layered parathas (lachha paratha) are slathered with green chutney and filled with spicy and smoky paneer (Indian cottage cheese) and mixed bell pepper filling.

        Originating in Kolkata, Kathi Roll has become one of Indiaâ€™s most popular street food.
        
        They are great for comforting dinners, get-togethers, tea parties, or potlucks. You can also pack them for school or office lunch boxes.
        
        I like to fill the rolls with a spicy chicken filling and make chicken kathi rolls. For a vegetarian version, these paneer rolls are my favorite.
        
        This paneer kathi roll recipe is very versatile. You can customize it to your liking. Adjust the spice levels, add or omit vegetables according to your preferences, and experiment with different sauces or chutneys for added flavor.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p><strong>To Marinate The Paneer</strong>
            You will need paneer, mustard oil, Kashmiri red chili powder, turmeric powder, ginger garlic paste, garam masala powder, thick plain yogurt (dahi, curd), salt, Kasuri methi, and freshly squeezed lime juice.
            
            If mustard oil is unavailable, use any cooking oil in its place.
            
            You can make paneer at home or use a store-bought one. If the store-bought paneer is hard, immerse it in hot water for a few minutes to soften it.
            
            To make a vegan version of the paneer roll recipe, you can use tofu instead of paneer and coconut yogurt or cashew cream instead of yogurt.<br>
            
            <strong>For The Filling</strong>
            You will need mixed bell peppers, cooking oil, onions, tomatoes, and tomato ketchup to make the filling.
            
            I have used green, yellow, and red bell peppers to make it more colorful; you can choose to use one of them too.<br>
            
            <strong>For Assembling</strong>
            To assemble the roll, you will need lachha paratha, green chutney, onions, chaat masala powder, cilantro (fresh coriander leaves), and freshly squeezed lime juice (or lemon juice).
            
            You can make lachha paratha at home or use store-bought frozen ones to save time.
            
            To make the rolls healthier, use healthy whole wheat flour parathas. To make this dish gluten-free, use gluten-free lachha paratha.
            
            You can also use leftover roti or flour tortillas instead of lachha paratha.</p>
