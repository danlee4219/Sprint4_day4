            <p><b>Neeraj</b> was bullied for his weight as a child, which led to his father enrolling him in a gym in Madlauda and later in Panipat. Jaiveer Choudhary, a javelin thrower, was aware of his talent as he frequented the Panipat Sports Authority. He also served as Neeraj’s initial trainer. After that, Naseem Ahmad began training Neeraj at the Tau Devi Lal Sports Complex in Panchkula. He taught him how to throw the javelin and run a long distance. He was able to throw a distance of 55 meters, but when it came time to compete in the 2012 Junior Championship in Lucknow, he set a record throw of 68.40 meters. He threw a record-breaking 81.04 meters in the junior division and 70 meters at the senior national competition. After that, he got a call from NIS Patiala, where he went to train. Silver was Neeraj’s first medal, won in the 2014 Youth Olympics Qualification in Bangkok. Chopra set a record at the South Asian Games, throwing 87.3 meters to win gold. Again, he had a successful year in 2016, but owing to a conflicting cutoff date, he was unable to qualify for the Olympics in Rio. At the 2016 IAAF World U20 Championships in Bydgoszcz, Poland, he won the gold medal and set a junior world record in the javelin throw with a throw of 86.48 meters.</p>
